# Task
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty, treat it as a filename, read the contents from that file, and write the final re-statement back to a file with the same name but suffixed with _output before the file ext.
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, read the contents of my clipboard (via `xclip`), and copy the final re-statement to the clipboard via `xclip -selection clipboard`.
- Before composing the re-statement, ask:
    - whether i want you to propose a short list of possible angles/approaches, and/or
    - provide an instruction re: what to focus on
- Ask me what facet I want as the primary focus and opening of the re-statement, and wait for my input.
- Write a succinct re-statement that conveys the key ideas.

# Content Constraints
- Do not refer to any individuals if it is a conversion.
- Do not refer to the text itself.
- Do not make it sound like you are writing a summary of something.
- Describe the ideas and points in abstract.

# Structure
- Use no more than one sentence per paragraph.
- Start with the conclusion or take-away, insofar as this is possible without impacting clarity.

# Style
- Make it as info-dense as possible while also being clear for someone who has not read the original text.
- Ensure it is very succinct.
- Avoid filler wording.
- Avoid wishy washiness.
