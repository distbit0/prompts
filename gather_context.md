Search this vault for files that contain content related to `$ARGUMENTS`. Do not modify any existing files. Create a new Markdown (`.md`) file for this topic and populate it with all relevant excerpts from the files you find. For each excerpt, include a `[[wikilink]]` to the source file. Organize the output with headings for each sub-topic, and group the excerpts under the appropriate sub-topic heading. If it is unclear/ambiguous which excerpts are relevant to the specified topic, feel free to ask questions to clarity intent/meaning.
