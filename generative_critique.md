If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty, treat it as a filename, read the contents from that file, and answer the questions below about it.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, read the contents from the clipboard via `xclip`, answer the questions below about it, and copy your answers to the clipboard via `xclip -selection clipboard`.

Regarding the file/clipboard contents:
- what good questions am i not asking?
- come up with some generative questions about it
- what constraints could I relax here to achieve much better or interesting outcomes?
- what would an expert do differently from laypeople in this context?
- what do experts disagree on & why?
- what are open questions about this?
- what am I missing that an expert might catch?
- play devil’s advocate:challenge my assertions.
- what is the biggest non-obvious vulnerability in this system?
