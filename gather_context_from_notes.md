Search this vault for files whose content relates to `$ARGUMENTS`.

As you review results, identify additional keywords that help you find relevant documents. Follow `[[markdown links]]` from one document to another when they appear relevant.

Do not modify any existing files.

Create a new Markdown (`.md`) file for this topic. Save the output to a filename that ends with `_CONTEXT.md`.

Populate the file with excerpts that you found AND that you judge as relevant. For each excerpt, include a `[[wikilink]]` to the source file.

If it is unclear which excerpts are relevant to the specified topic, ask questions to clarify intent and meaning before generating the report, and allow for follow-up if there are multiple dimensions.

Organize the output with headings for each sub-topic, and group excerpts under the appropriate sub-topic heading.
