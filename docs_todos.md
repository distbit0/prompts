please for each of the todos in the todo file in this repo:
- find the document section(s) which you think it relates to and propose a change to address the todo
- ask me if this is correct or if i'd like to offer a clarification
- keep updating your suggestion based on my clarification until i accept it
- only then, implement your suggestion and remove the todo from the todo file
- then move to the next todo until all are complete. do not skip any unless I ask you to
