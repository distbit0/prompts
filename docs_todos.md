please for each of these todos: 

- If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty, treat it as a filename, read the todos from that file
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, read the todos from the clipboard via `xclip`


one by one, find the document section which you think it relates to and propose a change, then ask me if this is correct or if i'd like to offer a clarification, then keep updating your suggestion until i accept it, then move to the next todo until all are complete. do not skip any.
