please for each of these todos: 

- If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty, treat it as a filename, read the todos from that file
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, read the todos as text from the clipboard via the `xclip` command


once you have found the todos, go through each todo one by one:
- find the document section(s) which you think it relates to and propose a change to address the todo
- ask me if this is correct or if i'd like to offer a clarification
- keep updating your suggestion until i accept it
- then move to the next todo until all are complete. do not skip any
