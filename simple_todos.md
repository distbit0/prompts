todo source and scope: if $ARGUMENTS is set, it is the todo source file (todos under "# -- SCRATCHPAD") and the only file you may modify; if blank, use the repo's todo file and normal scope.

please for each todo in the source:
- find the files/code/documents/sections which you think it relates to and propose a change to address the todo
- ask me if this is correct or if i'd like to offer a clarification
- keep updating your suggestion based on my clarification until i accept it or I implicitly accept it by telling you to take some action
- implement your suggestion and remove the todo from the todo file
- then move to the next todo until all are complete. do not skip any unless I ask you to
