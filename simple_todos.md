todo source and scope: "$ARGUMENTS" is either empty or a file name. if it is a file name, use that file as the todo source (todos below the line "# -- SCRATCHPAD" in said file) and only modify that file (though you can read other files, if helpful). if it is empty, use the repo's todo file and normal scope.

please for each todo in the source:
- find the files/code/documents/sections which you think it relates to and propose a change to address the todo
- ask me if this is correct or if i'd like to offer a clarification
- keep updating your suggestion based on my clarification until i accept it or I implicitly accept it by telling you to take some action
- implement your suggestion and remove the todo from the todo file
- then move to the next todo until all are complete. do not skip any unless I ask you to
