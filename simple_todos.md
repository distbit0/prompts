Todo source and scope: "$ARGUMENTS" is either empty or a file name. 
If it is a file name, todos to be completed are listed at the bottom of the file. Only modify that file, though you can read other files if helpful. If "$ARGUMENTS" is empty, use the repo-wide todo file and repo-wide editing scope.

For each todo:
- Find the code, documents, or sections it requires modification of, and propose a change that addresses it.
- Ask me if this is correct or if I would like to offer a clarification.
- Keep updating your suggestion based on my clarification until I accept it, or I implicitly accept it by telling you to take an action.
- Implement your suggestion and remove the todo from the todo file.
- Move to the next todo until all are complete. Do not skip any unless I ask you to.
